Implementing the solution (Pseudo Code):

SET max_capacity = 100
SET current_cars = 0

Situation 1:
WHEN vehicle arrives:
    IF vehicle is registered THEN
        IF current_cars < max_capacity THEN
            Open barrier
            current_cars = current_cars + 1
        ELSE
            Trigger alert: "Parking Full"
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        Keep barrier closed
    ENDIF
    Display available spots = max_capacity - current_cars

Sitaution 2:
WHEN vehicle exits:
    current_cars = current_cars - 1
    Display available spots = max_capacity - current_cars
